## 3. Functionalities

<ins>Race strategy optimisation</ins>: algorithm to optimize pit stop
strategy, taking into account tire degradation, fuel consumption, track
conditions, and other relevant factors.

<ins>Driver performance analysis</ins>: driver performance to provide
personalized feedback on their drivign style to help improve lap times.

<ins>Car setup optimisation</ins>: optimize the car setup, such as suspension
settings, aerodynamics and engine mapping based on historical data and current
track conditions.

<ins>Opponent modelling</ins>: model the strategies and performance of other
teams and drivers.

<ins>Real-time anomaly detection</ins>: detect any unusual patterns or
mechanical issues in the car's telemetry data in real-time to prevent potential
failures.


## 4. Not Released Yet

### 4.1 Current Stage

Right now, I am building the "data source" for the project. Building something
that produces random data that makes sense takes some time, especially
generating random car speeds on a random track with randon turns and random
characteristics for a driver. Way too many random events... So for now, please
enjoy these interface ideas from
[Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F).
